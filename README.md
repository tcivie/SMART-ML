## üö¶ Project Description

Traffic management remains a critical concern for urban planners and authorities. Traditional traffic light systems often fall short in optimizing vehicular flow and minimizing wait times. This literature review explores the innovative approaches brought forth by Machine Learning (ML) to address these challenges.

ML, a pivotal branch of Artificial Intelligence (AI), has revolutionized the way we handle complex tasks such as traffic management. By employing algorithms that learn from data, ML enables the creation of systems that can predict and adapt to changing conditions without explicit programming.

This study focuses on the examination of Self-Learning Machine Learning Algorithms for Responsive Traffic Lights (SMART Lights), specifically delving into a myriad of ML techniques including Reinforcement Learning (RL), Transfer Learning (TL), Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), and Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL).

## üèÅ Goals

The primary objectives of this study are to:

1. **Minimize wait time** for individual vehicles at intersections.
2. **Reduce the overall number of vehicles** at intersections.

Additionally, we aim to assess the efficacy of integrating Multi-Agent systems and the adaptability of the model through Transfer Learning techniques.

## üìö Background

Advances in ML offer new solutions for traffic management. This review synthesizes current research on SMART Lights, with an emphasis on ML techniques such as RL, TL, DRL, and MARL to create a robust, adaptive, and efficient traffic management system.

## üõ† Methodology

A network of virtual machines will be employed to run traffic simulations using SUMO (Simulation of Urban MObility) software. The machine learning models will interact with these simulations via the SUMO API, while Weights and Biases (W&B) will be utilized for performance logging and hyperparameter tuning.

## üìà Anticipated Outcomes

The study anticipates that the integration of ML techniques with statistical methods will lead to improved traffic management outcomes, particularly in minimizing wait times and reducing congestion.
